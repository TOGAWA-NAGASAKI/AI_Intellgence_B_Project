# AI_Intellgence_B_Project
Project for AIB (SUSTech/10/24)
Hello for my teammates from this class and other visitors! This is an project for Artifical Intellgence class whcih is related to the CartPole system is a classic control problem used in reinforcement learning, where the goal is to balance a pole on a moving cart.
In this project, we are planned to:
**- learn the Reinforcement Learning of AI**
**- comparing different training methods including DQN, Double-DQN, PPO etc.**
**- trying to make some advanced progress such as Offline RL and Imitation Learning**
Hopefully we can work on this project together and make our first soild step on the path of AI!
